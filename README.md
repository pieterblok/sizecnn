# HarvestCNN using ORCNN(Detectron2) and an additional depth regression
**ORCNN was extracted from: https://github.com/waiyulam/ORCNN **

ORCNN (Occlusion-aware RCNN) propose an all-in-one, end to end trainable multi-task
model for semantic segmentation that simultaneously predicts amodal masks,
visible masks, and occlusion masks for each object instance in an image in a
single forward pass. On the COCO amodal dataset, ORCNN outperforms the current
baseline for amodal segmentation by a large margin.

The amodal mask is defined as the union of the visible mask and the invisible
occlusion mask of the object.

In this repository, we provide the code to train and evaluate ORCNN. We also
provide tools to visualize occlusion mask annotation and results.
